1. Use given distance and velocity

x:
position,
velocity,
angle

y
distance,
velocity,

u

acceleration
angular velocity

2. Use given distance and velocity, more greedy than 1

x:
position,
velocity,
angle

y
distance, (0,y,0)
velocity, (0,vy,0)

u

acceleration
angular velocity

H_zeroVec

when zero vector, it means also that z position is 0

3. use left and right foot information

Collect information from both left and right foot. Based on the fact whether that foot 
is landing or not, we assign different level of trust to the information from that foot

4. similar to 3, but heuristically invert the sign of z component of one foot to tackle
the z direction drift
